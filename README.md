# gof-design-pattern-practice
A repository for practicing Gang of Four design patterns

## Quick Hits

**Q**:  Who are the Gang of Four (GoF)?

**A**:  These badasses:  [Erich Gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Gamma), Richard Helm, [Ralph Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Johnson_(computer_scientist)), and [John Vlissides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vlissides).  They literally wrote [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=design+patterns&qid=1564180115&s=gateway&sr=8-3) on design patterns.

**Q**:  What are design patterns?

**A**:  In this context, a design pattern is a healthy solution to a common problem in [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

**Q**:  What is the purpose of this repository?

**A**:  This repository exists to expose developers to the concept of design patterns, to encourage building demos as practice, and to develop healthy learning techniques for working professionals.

## How to Participate

1. Pick a design pattern from [here](https://www.dofactory.com/net/design-patterns).  Consider doing the same one others are doing.  The more perspectives we have per pattern, the better.
2. Write a small, unique demonstration of the pattern.  Try to come up with a real-world scenario.  Try to limit the contents of the example to the pattern itself.
  * Complete your work on your own branch.
  * Your demonstration **must** contain a test suite (e.g. xunit) or test app (e.g. a console app).
  * Your demonstration **must** be its own project(s).  Use the following naming conventions:
    * PatternName.DeveloperName.Description (e.g. Strategy.Jarrod.TaskScheduler)
    * PatternName.DeveloperName.Description.Test (e.g. Strategy.Jarrod.TaskScheduler.Test)
3. Reflect on your experience.  This is the **most important** component of this exercise.  Write and include a readme.md in your main project.  Consider your reflection to be a living document of your understanding of the concept.  It should include (but not be limited to):
  * **Purpose**:  In your own words, describe the pattern what it does.
  * **Application**:  Think about how you would recognize a potential use case.  Maybe include an example from a time when it would have been useful in your work.
  * **Review (experience)**:  Review your experience of practicing the pattern.  For example:
    * Did you have trouble coming up with an example?
    * Did you have trouble understanding the purpose of the pattern when you started out?  What about afterwards?
    * How good are the materials that you utilized while learning the pattern?
    * Does the pattern actually apply to your problem set?
  * **Review (pattern)**:  Review the pattern itself.  For example:
    * How useful is the pattern?  With what caveats?
    * How well does it accomplish its purpose?
    * How does this pattern relate to others you've learned?
    * Do you think you will use it in the future?  Why or why not?
4. Submit a pull request for your example.
5. Review and test others' projects.
